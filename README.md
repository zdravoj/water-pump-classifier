# Tanzania Water Pump Analysis DS36

The Tanzanian government has worked with for-profit and non-profit organizations to build water pumps across Tanzania to provide its denizens with potable water. These pumps need maintenance to continue to operate. Before the repair teams can be sent, they need to know which pumps need replacement or repair. It is expensive and time-consuming to send teams to all water pumps to determine which are non-functional. The purpose of this dataset analysis is to create a machine learning algorithm that can determine which pumps are non-functional to save the time and money of the Tanzanian government and its cooperative organizations.

This data was from a private Kaggle competition held by BloomTech for its DS36 Data Science cohort; its data mirrors that of the community Kaggle competition. Data files are not included per Kaggle and BloomTech guidelines.

DS36_Unit_2_Kaggle_Project_Notebook.ipynb is the result of analysis done during the Kaggle competition. However, the notebook was constructed 'on-the-fly' and is therefore poorly structured for reader comprehension.

Tanzania_Water_Pump_Analysis.ipynb aims to correct this by providing a clear, concise, and well-structured narrative of how the work was done. **This notebook is currently in progress and as of now contains only the first round of exploratory data analysis and feature engineering.**
